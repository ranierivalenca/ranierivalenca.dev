  Hey there, I am <strong>Ranieri Valen√ßa de Carvalho</strong> üëãüèº! As I stated on my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ranierivalenca/">LinkedIn</a> account, since <span>2007</span>, when I was just an internal on a local company, I'm a challenge driven <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong> and since <span>2015</span> I'm also a <strong>Web Development Teacher</strong> who loves to program and automate stuffs around just for fun.
</p>
<p>
  I'm also eager for knowledge in diverse fields like mathematics, phylosophy, psicology, physics, biology, biochemistry, ...
</p>
<p>
  Currently I work as a full-time teacher at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ifpe.edu.br/campus/igarassu">IFPE - Instituto Federal de Pernambuco</a>, a Brazilian Federal public institution, teaching courses like <span>Web Development I</span>, <span>Web Development II</span>, <span>Advanced Topics in Web Development</span> and <span>Distributed Systems</span>. I also keep creating softwares in order to improve my knowledge and learn new technologies / stacks.
</p>
